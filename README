threaded-code-interpreter
is a simple language implementation technic
which is widely used in forth language community
in forth it is also called 'the inner interpreter'

this repo teaches you
how to embed threaded-code-interpreter in other language (called host-language)
by examples

in my view
every programmer should understand threaded-code-interpreter thoroughly
and use it as a concrete model
to learn the semantics of other languages
(so called operational semantics)
