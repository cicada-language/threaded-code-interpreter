# threaded-code-interpreter

threaded-code-interpreter is a simple language implementation technic,
which is widely used in forth language community,
in forth it is also called 'the inner interpreter'.

## aim

this repo teaches you
how to embed threaded-code-interpreter in other language by examples.

in my view,
every programmer should understand threaded-code-interpreter thoroughly,
and use it as a concrete model
to learn the semantics of other languages.
(so called operational semantics)

## plan

I will add more and more versions of interpreters.
and, to help you learn, I will write more documentations to explain the technic used.

## learn with me

you do not have to fork this repo to learn it,
you can simply copy the code and play with it,
and create your own repo,
if you add something new worth sharing,
you can editing [this wiki page](https://github.com/cicada-language/threaded-code-interpreter/wiki/Interpreters)
to share.

best wishes :)
